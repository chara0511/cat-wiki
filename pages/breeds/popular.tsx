          <h2> 1. British Longhair The British</h2>
          <p>
            Longhair is a very laid-back relaxed cat, often perceived to be very independent
            although they will enjoy the company of an equally relaxed and likeminded cat. They are
            an affectionate breed, but very much on their own terms and tend to prefer to choose to
            come and sit with their owners rather than being picked up.

          <h2>2. American Curl</h2>
          <p>
            Distinguished by truly unique ears that curl back in a graceful arc, offering an alert,
            perky, happily surprised expression, they cause people to break out into a big smile
            when viewing their first Curl. Curls are very people-oriented, faithful, affectionate
            soulmates, adjusting remarkably fast to other pets, children, and new situations.
